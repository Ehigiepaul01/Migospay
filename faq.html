          <div class="accordion-header">How Can I use MigosPay?</div>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            To use MigosPay, you first need to download the mobile app on your
            smartphone from the app store. Once you have downloaded and
            installed the app, you can create an account by entering your
            personal information such as your name, email address, and phone
            number. <br /> <br>

            To ensure the security of your account and transactions, MigosPay
            requires you to set up a strong and unique password. We recommend
            that you use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters,
            numbers, and special characters to create a secure password. <br />

            Once you have created your account and password, you can link your
            MigosPay account to your bank account or debit/credit card. This
            will enable you to make payments directly from your MigosPay
            account. <br /> <br>

            When making a payment using MigosPay, you will need to enter your
            username and password to authenticate your transaction. MigosPay
            takes security very seriously and uses industry-standard encryption
            and security protocols to protect your personal and financial
            information. <br /> <br>

            It's important to remember that you should never share your MigosPay
            username and password with anyone, and you should always log out of
            your account when you're finished using the app. Additionally, we
            recommend that you regularly update your password and enable
            two-factor authentication for added security. <br /> <br>

            In summary, using MigosPay is easy and secure. By creating a strong
            password and following best practices for account security, you can
            use MigosPay with confidence knowing that your transactions are
            protected.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            Open the MigosPay app on your smartphone and log in to your account
            using your username and password. <br /> <br>

            On the home screen, you should see your account balance and recent
            transactions. If you don't see the transactions you're looking for,
            you can tap on the "Transactions" tab at the bottom of the screen.
            <br /> <br>

            In the Transactions section, you can view a list of all your recent
            transactions, including the date, time, amount, and merchant or
            recipient. <br /> <br>

            If you want to see more details about a particular transaction, you
            can tap on it to view additional information such as the transaction
            ID, status, and any associated fees. <br /> <br>
            You can also filter your transactions by date range, type of
            transaction (debit or credit), and transaction status (completed,
            pending, or failed) using the filter button located at the top right
            corner of the Transactions page. <br /> <br>

            In addition to viewing your transactions within the app, MigosPay
            also sends you real-time notifications for each transaction,
